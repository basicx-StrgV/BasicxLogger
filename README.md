## ‚ùì What is BasicxLogger

BasicsLogger is a logger library for dotnet, that offers functions to create and  
write to different types of log files or write logs to a database. 

It is designed to be as easy to use as possibel without losing functionalities.

The library is modular.  
Because of that its easy to add support for different file formates or databases, or even to add new logger.  
File support, database support and new logger can also be added as a extension.  
This will be done, if it will otherwise add to much or unwanted dependencies to the main package.
