# ❗ Attention
**This repository is intended as a reference and archive.**  
This project was my first “bigger” project and my first GitHub project.  
I mainly did it for fun and to learn something.
Because I don't use the library and there are much better alternatives, the library will not receive any updates, including security patches.
